Amesp website and documentation
===============================

## Overview

The Amesp website and documentation are written in a combination of Markdown and
reStructuredText, using `sphinx-doc` and several associated extensions to
generate static `html` files. 

## Building the docs locally

### Requirements

Pip install the following packages, which are also listed in `requirements.txt`:

- pyscf
- sphinx
- sphinx-material
- sphinxcontrib-bibtex
- nbsphinx

### Building
All sphinx related sources files (i.e. `.rst` and `.md`) are contained in `source` and all webpage files (once they're generated) live in the `build`.

To generate the website (without the API docs) run the following from the main project directory.
If you are running on Linux, and you want to build faster you can use `make html_parallel`.

```bash
make html
```

To see more of the options you can use with `make`, just use `make help`.


### Serving
Finally to serve the website, you can run:

```bash
 python -m http.server --directory build/html
```


### Adding Content to GitHub Pages

If you want to show the latest version of the docs on GitHub pages, build using then instructions above. Then from `pyscf-doc/source` run the following:

```bash
make gh_pages_setup
```

## How to Contribute

1.  Add a rst file \"your\_method.rst\" in the [source/user](source/user/) directory in which one describes the basic theory and usage of the method. Reference \"user/your\_method.rst\" in the \"toctree\" section in [source/user.rst](source/user.rst).
2.  Add a rst file \"your\_module.rst\" in the [source/modules](source/modules/) directory in which one lists the examples and the member classes and functions of the module (the API doc is then generated by autodoc). (In the \"\_\_init\_\_.py\" file of each module, one should include a simple usage section. See [pyscf.dft.\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/pyscf/dft/__init__.py) as an example.) Reference \"your\_module.rst\" in the \"toctree\" section in [source/modules.rst](source/modules.rst).
3.  Optionally, one could also add a rst file \"your\_method\_develop.rst\" in the  [source/develop](source/develop/) directory where one provides more detailed descriptions of the implementation and advanced guidelines for using and further development of the module. Reference \"your\_method\_develop.rst\" in [source/develop.rst](source/develop.rst). 


<!-- ## Adding Blog Posts

Create a new `.md` file in `pyscf-doc/source/posts` and add the following header (modified for your post):

```
---
blogpost: true
date: February 1, 2021
author: James Smith
location: World
category: Tutorial
tags: HF, DFT, MCSCF
language: English
---
```

If you want to write a post in `.rst` that's fine too! Just use the following in your header:

```
:blogpost: true
:date: Oct 10, 2020
:author: Nabil Freij
:location: World
:category: Manual
:language: English
``` -->
